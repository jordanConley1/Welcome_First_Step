Able To Articulate The Process Of Server Request/Response
Answer: So each and every website is stored on something called a server, which is basically a computer that is connected to the internet and is able to receive requests like this one. So again, when we browse to a certain website our web browser will send a request to the server where the website is stored, so where it is hosted.

Able To Identify Front-End Web Dev Languages
Answer:  HTML is responsible for the content of the page Then the CSS, is responsible for the presentation Now finally, JavaScript is the actual programming language

Able To Identify Back-End Web Dev Languages
Answer: Well, a complex site like udemy.com is really completely different from a static site because there is a lot of content that is always changing all the time. Like on Udemy, there are always new courses and new reviews being added to the site. New ratings, and new course length are calculated for example, and really a bunch of other things like that are always happening. And so in order to make a system like this work udemy.com needs a whole application running on the server and they also need a big database, which basically contains all the courses, and all the reviews, all the users, and really all the content that is being displayed on their website. Now, to do all this front-end technologies like HTML and CSS are simply not enough. So basically, with what you're gonna learn in this course, you are not going to be able to build something like udemy.com, all right? So to write applications that are actually executed on web servers, developers use some kind of back-end language like Node.js, PHP, or Python. So what these languages do is to take data out of a database and basically assemble that data into the final files that will then be sent to the browser as the response. And this whole process is called back-end development
